# Student Management System

## Project Overview

This C++ project implements a Student Management System, allowing users to manage student details, courses, and perform various operations related to student data. The system is designed to be modular, employing dynamic memory allocation and incorporating principles such as binary search and structured data.

## Files

1. **main.cpp**: Main program file initializing the student manager and calling the menu function.
2. **Student_info.txt**: Text file containing initial student information (IDs and names).
3. **Course_info.txt**: Text file containing initial course information (student IDs, course numbers, and grades).
4. **students_dec.h**: Header file with declarations of structs, constants, and function prototypes.
5. **students_imp.cpp**: Implementation file with code for functions declared in students_dec.h.
6. **students_mng.cpp**: Implementation file containing the menu function and supporting functions.

## Code Writing Principles

1. **Modularity**: Code is organized into modular functions handling specific tasks.
2. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Utilizes dynamic memory for managing arrays of students and their courses.
3. **Binary Search**: Includes a binary search function for efficient student lookup based on ID.
4. **Input Validation**: Ensures user input in the menu is within valid range.
5. **File Handling**: Reads initial student and course data from text files with error handling.
6. **Structured Data**: Uses structs (`student` and `course`) to organize data.
7. **Pointer Arithmetic**: Employed for managing dynamic memory efficiently.

> and repeat!


## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Ensure `Student_info.txt` and `Course_info.txt` are present in the project directory.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations on student data.

### hope the system will be useful and helpful!
